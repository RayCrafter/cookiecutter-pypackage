cookiecutter-pypackage
======================

Cookiecutter template for a Python package. See https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.

I adapted the pypackage from nekroze a little bit for my needs.
The doc has the sphinx theme already installed.
It uses the https://github.com/storax/jinjaapidoc package to create the api documenation.
